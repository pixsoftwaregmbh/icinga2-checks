# Collection of Icinga2/Nagios checks

## Intro
This repo contains checks that we have written for our Icinga2 monitoring system. These should also be compatible with Nagios.

## Important note
This checks were written and tested on our setup. Might not work for everyone.
The work is of limited scope. Feel free to use it tho. If you would like to add new features submit a pull request or fork the repo. Bug reports are welcomed.

## Documentation
Each check should have a doc ending with .md inside the docs folder.
